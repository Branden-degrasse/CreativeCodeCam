## Particle Effect Face Tracker
### By: Branden De Grasse

## Description:

 

My webcam takes the points that the clmtrackr takes and maps them to the particle effect that I got from open processing. I edited the original code, so it doesn’t crash the website, and it also isn’t on the mouse. Originally the program would take the mouseDragged() function and use an algorithm called Delaunay to make it look like ice by mapping the data into triangles. I removed the Delaunay effect, and changed the life cycle of the particles so that the face effect could still be seen while using the face cam. While the tracking of the camera can sometimes cause the picture to look a little confusing with the mass of particles. The face effect can still be seen. Then I took the example in class with the color changing and added it to the particle effects. I also managed to translate the video to roughly the center of the window. (at least with a 1920, 1080 monitor) I wish I could’ve gotten the Delaunay algorithm to work but p5 would not have it for some reason? I also made the background black to pop out the colors of the face, and the description at the bottom of the screen.
